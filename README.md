## Overview

Mano_Computer refers to a simplified model of a computer used to understand the basic principles of computing. In this model, a computer is imagined as a person carrying out instructions. The instructions, or orders, are represented by simple commands that the person (or computer) can understand and execute.

In the Mano_Computer model, the orders that can be executed typically include basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as logical operations like comparisons , and branching instructions ( if-then statements). These instructions are usually represented in a simple symbolic language, similar to assembly language but even more basic.
